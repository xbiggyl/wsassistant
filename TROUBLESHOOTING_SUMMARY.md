# MeetAssist Troubleshooting Summary

## Project Overview
MeetAssist is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant consisting of:
- **Chrome Extension**: Captures audio/video from Google Meet
- **Node.js Backend Server**: Processes audio, transcribes, and generates summaries
- **Shared Library**: Common utilities and types

## Current Status
The project is mostly functional but has a **WebSocket communication issue** between the extension and server.

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. Initial Setup Issues ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Package version conflicts with `node-whisper`
- **Solution**: Updated to latest version and fixed ESLint configurations

### 2. Build Configuration Issues ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: TypeScript path aliases and composite settings
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `"composite": true` to shared tsconfig
  - Updated path aliases to point to built shared package (`../shared/dist`)
  - Fixed import paths from `@shared` to `@meetassist/shared`

### 3. Node.js ESM Module Issues ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Missing `.js` extensions in imports
- **Solution**: Added `.js` extensions to all imports in shared/src/index.ts

### 4. Extension Build Issues ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Static files not copying properly, manifest overwrites
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Vite config to copy static files
  - Set `emptyOutDir: false` in content script build config
  - Created separate Vite config for content scripts

### 5. WebSocket Connection Issues ‚úÖ PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Extension showing "Disconnected" despite server running
- **Root Cause**: Content script not receiving status messages from background script
- **Current Status**: Server connects successfully, but status messages don't reach sidebar

## Current Problem: Message Chain Breakdown

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Server**: Running on port 3001, responding to health checks
2. **WebSocket**: Server accepts connections, sends status messages
3. **Background Script**: Connects to server, receives status messages
4. **Sidebar**: Loads and displays correctly

### What's Broken ‚ùå
**Message Chain**: Server ‚Üí Background Script ‚Üí Content Script ‚Üí Sidebar

**Evidence**:
- Server logs show: "Client connected", "Sent connection confirmation"
- Background script logs show: "Background received backend message", "Found tabs: 1"
- Background script fails with: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."
- Sidebar only receives `init` message, not `status` message

### Debugging Steps Taken
1. ‚úÖ Added detailed logging to server WebSocket setup
2. ‚úÖ Added logging to background script message handling
3. ‚úÖ Added logging to content script message handling
4. ‚úÖ Added logging to sidebar message handling
5. ‚úÖ Implemented retry mechanism in background script
6. ‚úÖ Added manual content script injection

### Current Debug Output
**Server Console**:
```
Setting up WebSocket server on path /ws
Starting MeetAssist server...
Initializing storage service...
Storage service initialized
Initializing transcription service...
Transcription service initialized
Initializing summary service...
Summary service initialized
Initializing email service...
Email service initialized
Setting up WebSocket server...
WebSocket server setup complete
WebSocket server is listening for connections
üöÄ MeetAssist server started on port 3001
Client connected: [clientId] from ::1
WebSocket URL: /ws
Sent connection confirmation to client [clientId]
```

**Background Script Console**:
```
Background received backend message: Object
Found tabs: 1
Sending message to tab: [tabId] Object
Failed to send message to tab: [tabId] Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
Retrying in 1000ms (attempt 1)
```

**Sidebar Console**:
```
Sidebar received event: MessageEvent
Event origin: https://meet.google.com
Window location origin: chrome-extension://[extensionId]
Message type: init
Message payload: undefined
```

## Next Steps to Fix

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Verify Content Script Injection**: Check if content script logs appear in Meet page console
2. **Fix Message Forwarding**: Ensure status messages reach the sidebar
3. **Test Complete Flow**: Verify sidebar shows "Connected" status

### Files Modified During Troubleshooting
- `server/src/index.ts`: Added detailed logging and DEBUG environment variable
- `shared/src/index.ts`: Added types export
- `extension/src/background.ts`: Added retry mechanism and manual content script injection
- `extension/src/content/inject.ts`: Added status message forwarding and logging
- `extension/src/sidebar/sidebar.tsx`: Added debug logging and removed origin check
- `extension/manifest.json`: Added "tabs" permission

### Key Commands
```bash
# Build shared package
cd shared && pnpm build

# Build server
cd server && pnpm build

# Build extension
cd extension && pnpm build

# Start server
cd server && node dist/index.js

# Check if port is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill process on port
taskkill /PID [PID] /F
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: http://localhost:3001/health
- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Content script logs appear in Meet page console
- [ ] Background script receives status messages
- [ ] Sidebar shows "Connected" status
- [ ] WebSocket connection established

## Environment Details
- **OS**: Windows 10
- **Node.js**: v22.17.0
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Build Tool**: Vite + TypeScript
- **Extension**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3

## Notes
- The AudioContext error in Chrome console is expected and normal
- Service worker must be "active" for background script to work
- Origin check was blocking messages to sidebar iframe
- Manual content script injection should resolve timing issues

## Contact
When continuing on the new PC, focus on:
1. Verifying content script injection works
2. Ensuring the message chain is complete
3. Testing the complete flow from server to sidebar
